## Description 
The Happenings App is a social media application that uses a live, interactive map API that links to a user's review posts to a location and pins it to the map. When the user clicks on the location pin, they can see the post that was created by either themselves, a friend, or another user. Each review created also displays a star rating for the location pinned to help users decide on places and events to go to. The application also provides the capability of customizing a user's profile, and adding friends to their profile. When friends are added to an account, only posts from the user and their friends can be seen on the main dashboard.
